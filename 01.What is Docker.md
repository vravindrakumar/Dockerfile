# What is Docker?

## Short answer:**
"Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications in lightweight, portable containers. It allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different environments."

## Detailed answer (if asked):**
"Docker works by creating containers that package an application and its dependencies, including libraries and configurations. These containers are isolated from the host system and other containers, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments. Docker uses images as blueprints for containers, which can be shared through Docker Hub. It also integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to automate the deployment of containerized applications."
