# What is a Docker image?

## Short answer:
"A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools."

## Detailed answer (if asked):
"Docker images are the foundation for creating containers. They are built from a series of layers, with each layer representing an instruction in the image's Dockerfile. These layers are cached and shared across images to optimize storage and efficiency. When you run a Docker image, it becomes a container, allowing consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment. Images can be stored and distributed via container registries like Docker Hub or private repositories."
