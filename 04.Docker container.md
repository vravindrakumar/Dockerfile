# Docker container?

## Short answer:

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and settings. It isolates the application from the underlying system, ensuring it works consistently across different environments.


## Detailed answer (if asked):

Containers are built using Docker images, which are templates with the application and its dependencies. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system's kernel, making them faster to start and use fewer resources. Docker containers are widely used in DevOps for deploying applications in a portable and scalable way.
