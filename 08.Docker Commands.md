# Docker Commands ?

## IMAGES

Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package
of software that includes everything needed to run an application:
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings

### Build an Image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t <image_name>

### Build an Image from a Dockerfile without the cache
docker build -t <image_name> . –no-cache

### List local images
docker images

### Delete an Image
docker rmi <image_name>

### Remove all unused images
docker image prune 


## DOCKER HUB
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing
container images with your team. Learn more and find images
at https://hub.docker.com

### Login into Docker
```bash
docker login -u <username>
```

### Publish an image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push <username>/<image_name>
```
### Search Hub for an image

```bash
docker search <image_name>
```
### Pull an image from a Docker Hub
```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```

## CONTAINERS
A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container
will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure
that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between
development and staging.

### Create and run a container from an image, with a custom name:
```bash
docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
```
### Run a container with and publish a container’s port(s) to the host.
```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
```
### Run a container in the background
```bash
docker run -d <image_name>
```
### Start or stop an existing container:
```bash
docker start|stop <container_name> (or <container-id>)
```
### Remove a stopped container:
```bash
docker rm <container_name>
```
### Open a shell inside a running container:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> sh
```
### Fetch and follow the logs of a container:
```bash
docker logs -f <container_name>
```
### To inspect a running container:
```bash
docker inspect <container_name> (or <container_id>)
```
### To list currently running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
### List all docker containers (running and stopped):
```bash
docker ps --all
```
### View resource usage stats
```bash
docker container stats
```
