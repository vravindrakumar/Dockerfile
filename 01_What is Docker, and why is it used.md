1. **What is Docker, and why is it used?**

Ans)

**Short Answer:**

Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. This enables applications to run consistently across different environments, improving portability, efficiency, and simplifying deployment processes.

**Detailed Answer:**

Docker is a powerful platform designed for developing, shipping, and running applications within containers, which are lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed for the application to run—such as code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. Unlike traditional virtualization, Docker containers share the host OS's kernel, making them more resource-efficient and faster to start up. 

Using Docker provides several advantages:

1. **Portability**: Containers are portable across different environments (development, testing, production) and can run consistently on any system with Docker installed, reducing the "works on my machine" issue.
  
2. **Efficiency**: Containers use fewer resources compared to traditional VMs because they don’t require a full OS. This leads to faster startup times and allows more applications to run on the same hardware.

3. **Simplified Deployment**: Docker simplifies the deployment process, allowing for quick scaling and consistent setups in various environments. This makes it ideal for CI/CD pipelines in DevOps, as containers can be built, tested, and deployed in the same way regardless of the environment.
