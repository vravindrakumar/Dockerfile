12.What is a multi-stage build, and why is it useful?

**Short Answer:**

A multi-stage build in Docker allows you to define multiple build stages in a single Dockerfile. By using this technique, you can separate the build process into distinct stages, keeping only the necessary components in the final image. This results in smaller, more efficient Docker images as unnecessary build dependencies can be discarded.

**Detailed Answer:**

A multi-stage build in Docker is a feature that allows you to create a series of build stages in a single Dockerfile. Each stage starts from a base image, and you can copy artifacts from one stage to another. This is useful because it allows you to isolate the dependencies used during the build process, ensuring that only the essential components are included in the final image.

For example, in the first stage, you might use a full image with development tools to compile an application, and in the second stage, you use a minimal image (e.g., `alpine`) to copy over just the compiled binaries. This reduces the final image size by excluding unnecessary build dependencies like compilers or testing tools.

The key benefits are:
1. **Smaller Image Sizes**: Only the final necessary artifacts are included in the final image.
2. **Cleaner, More Secure Images**: Reduces the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary build dependencies.
3. **Improved Build Efficiency**: Multiple stages can help manage complex build processes more effectively without having to maintain multiple Dockerfiles.

In a real DevOps scenario, this technique is commonly used to streamline CI/CD pipelines and optimize containerized applications for faster deployment and better resource efficiency.
