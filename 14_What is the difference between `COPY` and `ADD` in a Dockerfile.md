14.What is the difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in a Dockerfile?

**Short Answer:**

`COPY` and `ADD` are both used to copy files in a Dockerfile, but `COPY` is preferred for simply copying files and directories from the local machine to the container. On the other hand, `ADD` has additional features like the ability to extract compressed files (e.g., `.tar` archives) and support remote URLs, which makes it more versatile but less predictable for basic file copying.

**Detailed Answer:**

In a Dockerfile, `COPY` and `ADD` are both used to copy files or directories from the host to the container, but they serve different purposes.

- **`COPY`**: This is the simpler and more predictable option. It is specifically used to copy files or directories from the local file system (the build context) into the container. It is a straightforward operation and is generally preferred for regular file copying since it is more explicit and avoids any unnecessary overhead.

- **`ADD`**: While `ADD` can also copy files like `COPY`, it has additional functionality. It can:
  - Automatically extract `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2` archives into the container’s filesystem.
  - Support copying files from remote URLs, which `COPY` does not.

However, because of these additional features, `ADD` can sometimes be overkill or introduce unintended consequences (e.g., extracting archives when it’s not needed). Therefore, **`COPY`** is preferred for simple file copying to avoid any potential surprises.

In practice, if you're not specifically needing remote file downloading or automatic extraction of compressed files, it's best to use `COPY` for clarity and efficiency.
