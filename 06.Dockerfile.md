# Dockerfile?

## Short Answer:

"A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, the application code, dependencies, and configurations needed to create a container."

## Detailed answer (if asked):

"A Dockerfile starts with a base image like `FROM ubuntu`, then adds the necessary steps such as copying application files, installing dependencies, and configuring environment variables. Each command in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image, making it efficient for reuse. You can also define commands like `RUN`, `CMD`, and `EXPOSE` to execute during container runtime or build time, making Dockerfiles a critical part of containerization in CI/CD pipelines."
