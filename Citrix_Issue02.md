# Frequent disconnections experienced by users during sessions

**Answer:**

Another significant issue I faced in a Citrix real-time project was frequent disconnections experienced by users during sessions. This was causing frustration and affecting workflow.

To solve this issue, I took the following steps:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** I analyzed logs from the Citrix environment and identified that the disconnections were primarily due to session timeouts and network instability.

2. **Session Timeout Adjustments:** I worked with the Citrix team to extend session timeout settings in the Citrix Studio, allowing users to remain connected longer without being disconnected.

3. **Network Stability Improvement:** I collaborated with the networking team to troubleshoot and optimize network routes. We conducted tests to identify any packet loss or latency issues and adjusted configurations accordingly.

4. **User Training:** I provided training sessions for users on how to reconnect quickly and efficiently in case of disconnections.

After implementing these measures, the frequency of disconnections decreased significantly, leading to improved user satisfaction and productivity.
