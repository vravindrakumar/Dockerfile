# Different between Docker and virtual machine?

## Short Answer:
"Docker uses containerization to isolate applications and their dependencies, sharing the host OS kernel, making it lightweight and faster to start. Virtual machines, on the other hand, require a full guest OS, which makes them heavier and slower compared to containers."

## Detailed Answer (if asked to elaborate):
"Containers, like those created by Docker, share the host OS kernel and package only the application and its dependencies. This makes containers lightweight, fast to start, and consume fewer resources. Virtual machines, however, run a full operating system along with the application on top of a hypervisor, which requires more memory, storage, and processing power. While VMs offer stronger isolation since each has its own OS, Docker containers are more efficient in scenarios where you need multiple environments on the same system."
