30.What is Docker Content Trust (DCT), and how does it enhance Docker security?

### Short Answer:
Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a security feature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of Docker images by requiring them to be signed using cryptographic keys. When DCT is enabled, only signed images can be pulled and used, preventing the use of untrusted or tampered images, thus enhancing the security of container deployments.

### Detailed Answer:
Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a security mechanism that leverages digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of Docker images. When DCT is enabled, Docker ensures that images are signed by a trusted key before they can be pulled from a registry. This prevents the deployment of compromised or unauthorized images, as only those that have been cryptographically signed by a trusted source will be allowed.

By enabling DCT, the Docker client checks for the presence of a valid signature before pulling or pushing an image. If the image is not signed or the signature is invalid, Docker will refuse to proceed. This adds a critical layer of security, especially when dealing with third-party images, ensuring that only trusted and verified images are used in production environments. DCT is an essential practice in securing the container lifecycle, especially in CI/CD pipelines.
