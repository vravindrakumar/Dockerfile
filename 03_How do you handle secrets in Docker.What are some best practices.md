### **Short Answer**  
In Docker, secrets should be managed securely by using tools like **Docker secrets** for Docker Swarm, **Kubernetes secrets** in Kubernetes, or third-party tools like **HashiCorp Vault**. Avoid embedding secrets directly in Dockerfiles, images, or passing them as plaintext environment variables. Instead, use secure methods like external secret stores and access controls to ensure safe handling.

### **Detailed Answer**  

1. **Avoid embedding secrets in images or Dockerfiles**  
   - Secrets (like API keys, passwords) should never be hardcoded into Dockerfiles or included in the image itself. This is insecure because anyone with access to the image can extract them.

2. **Use Docker Secrets (for Docker Swarm)**  
   - Docker Swarm provides built-in support for managing secrets securely.
   - Secrets are encrypted and only accessible to containers running on a service with explicit permissions.
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     echo "my_secret" | docker secret create my_secret -
     docker service create --secret my_secret my_service
     ```

3. **Handle Environment Variables with Caution**  
   - While easy to use, environment variables are less secure because they can be exposed in process lists or logs.
   - Use tools like `dotenv` or inject secrets at runtime using a more secure mechanism.

4. **Kubernetes Secrets (for Kubernetes)**  
   - Kubernetes provides a built-in mechanism for storing and managing sensitive information. These secrets are base64 encoded and can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables.
   - Use encryption at rest for added security with tools like KMS.
   - Example:  
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: my-secret
     type: Opaque
     data:
       password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64-encoded
     ```

5. **Third-Party Tools (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)**  
   - Tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault provide advanced secret management, including dynamic secrets, auditing, and encryption.
   - Integrate these with Docker or orchestration tools to fetch secrets dynamically.

6. **Best Practices**  
   - **Use Volumes for Secrets**: Mount secrets into containers as read-only files.
   - **Limit Scope**: Ensure secrets are only accessible to containers that need them.
   - **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: Automate secret rotation to minimize risks from leaks.
   - **Audit and Monitor Access**: Keep track of who accesses secrets.

By following these approaches, you ensure secrets are managed securely and aligned with DevOps best practices.
