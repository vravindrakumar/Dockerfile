# Create a Docker container?

## Short Answer:
"I create a Docker container by writing a `Dockerfile`, building an image from it using `docker build`, and then running the container with `docker run`."

## Detailed answer (if asked):
"First, I write a `Dockerfile` that specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and any environment variables. Then, I build the Docker image using `docker build` command, providing a tag for easy reference. Finally, I run the container using `docker run` with options like port mapping (`-p`) and environment variables (`-e`) if needed."
